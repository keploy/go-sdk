# How to Contribute

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the following prequisites are installed in your Operating System before you start contributing to the project - : 

- [Go](https://go.dev/)

To verify run :

```
go version
```

## Set up your Local Development Environment

Follow the following instructions to start contributing - 

1 . Fork [this](https://github.com/keploy/go-sdk.git)

2 . Clone the copy of your forked project

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/go-sdk.git
```

3 . Navigate to the project directory

```
cd go-sdk
```
4 . Add a remote reference (upstream) to the original repository.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/keploy/go-sdk.git
```

5 . Always take a pull from the upstream repository to your master branch to keep it updated with the main project.

```
git pull upstream main
```

6 . Configure the pre-commit hook by running the following path.

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks && chmod +x .githooks/*
```

7 . create a new branch

```
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

8 . Install the dependencies by running the following command

```
go get -u github.com/keploy/go-sdk
```

9 . Make the desired changes

10 . Track your changes 

```
git status
```

11 . Add your changes to staging area

```
git add .
```

12 . Commit your changes. [Please refer to this article to know more about the commit message convention followed by Keploy.](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

```
git commit -m "<commit message>"
```

13 . While you are working on your branch, other developers may update the `main` branch with their branch. This action means your branch is now out of date with the `main` branch and missing content which may lead to merge conflicts. So to avoid this fetch the new changes, follow along:

```
git checkout main
git fetch origin main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin
```

14 . Now you need to merge the `main` branch into your branch. This can be done in the following way -:

```
git checkout <your_branch_name>
git merge main
```

15 . Push the committed changes in your feature branch to your remote repository.

```
git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
```

Once you‚Äôve committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the compare & pull request button. This will create a Pull Request for your branch. Wait untill a contributor give you a feedback on the contribution. After the feedback your branch will be merged into main branch of the repository.
